make hostsRemote
make hostsLocal

 When working on a website with local dev server, we want change hosts file, so the site is served locally rather than remotely.

 The local website is located in the config.

 - hostRemote : domain will resolve to remote IP. Website served on remote production server
 - hostLocal  : domain will resolve to localhost. Website served on local development server
